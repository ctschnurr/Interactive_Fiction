            "You make your way around the side of the castle. Around the first corner you find a beautiful garden full of plants and flowers. The pathway continues on to the back of the castle.;Stop to smell the flowers;Proceed along the path;6;10",
            "You stand amidst a large library. Book cases line the walls and a large sofa sits in the center of the room. There are no apparent exits except to head back down to the main level.;Inspect the books;Return to main level;7;2",

The flower is so intoxicating you do not notice the vine wrap around your ankle. The vine suddenly yanks you into the brush and the garden swallows you whole. You are dead.", 
            "You approach the nearest bookshelf and begin to browse the titles. Most of the books are old and warn, covered in dust from years of stillness, except for two that appear to have been moved recently.;Look at book titled 'Greed';Look at book titled 'Hurricane Irene';8;9",

            "You pull 'Hurricane Irene' from the shelf and open it. A huge gust of wind emits from the book, knocking it from your hand and onto the floor, still open. The room fills with the torrential chaos of Hurricane Irene, battering the library, furniture, and you until essentially nothing is left. You are dead.",
            "You decide to continue forward down the path and away from the garden. As you round the corner to the back of the castle the pathway splits and cuts off to the right. In the distance you see a dock on a misty lake. To your left is the back door of the castle.;Check out the lake;Enter the castle;16;11",
            "The kitchen appears to have been cleaned shortly before being abandoned. The counters are clear and tidy beneath the layer of dust. A large dingy fridge sits silently in the corner. A door appears to lead outside, but can't be opened.;Open the Fridge;Head back to the hallway;13;5",
            "The lounge is dimly lit and dusty like the rest of the castle. A large sofa sits by the far wall, and a bar with various bottles of liquid is against the side.;Sit on the sofa;Check out the bar;18;19",
            "You reach for the fridge handle but just before you touch it the door bursts open. A giant grotesque tentacle reaches out, wraps around you, and pulls you to another demension. You are dead.",

            "You enter the secret hallway and walk through the darkness until you reach a door. By feeling your way you find a door knob, and a chain that could be a light switch.;Try the Door;Pull the Chain;20;14",
            "You approach the misty lake. It is still and quiet. You decide to pick up a stone to skip across. You toss the stone and it skips into the mist. As you turn to walk away, the stone returns and strikes you in the back of the head. You are dead.",
            "You take a long swig from the red liquid. You slowly go numb, then limp, then melt into a puddle on the floor. You are dead.",
            "You have a seat on the sofa. It is quite comfortable! You rest for a few minutes until you begin to feel sleepy. Slowly unconciousness overtakes you, and you begin to sink through the couch fabric and into the sofa itself. The couch digests you slowly over days. You are dead.",
            "You have a seat at the bar and pull two large bottles toward you. One is red and clear, the other blue and murky. Now you're here you have to drink!;Try the red;Drink the blue;17;21",
            "You try the door knob and the door swings open to reveal a room, empty save for a large chest full of treasure. You are alive, and now very rich. You won!",
            "You try the blue liquid. A coldness begins in your toes and slowly begins to radiate up your body. You realize you can't move as this feeling overtakes you. Within minutes you are frozen solid, never to move again. You area dead."
